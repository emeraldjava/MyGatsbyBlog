## Why did you leave WordPress?

WordPress is great. I recommend it for almost everything. That being said, I love to play with new things. I had heard of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site generator, and its integration with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and thought I'd try it out.

## Jekyll?

Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby. Where as with WordPress, all content is stored in a database and retrieved when it is needed to build the currently requested page, Jekyll skips the database and all pages are pre-compiled and ready to serve. This provides a number of benefits. 

* Speed - All pages are ready to be served, nothing is required on the backend.
* Security - There is no database to be hacked or corrupted, there is no admin that needs to be protected. To restore a site, simply delete the files and re-upload them.
* Your content, in your hands - Posts are written in markdown and then compiled into html. The original files are on your hard drive, or better yet, they live on GitHub.

## My Thoughts

So far my experience with jekyll has been pleasant. My first 'job' was creating a theme. I had built two WordPress themes before [Mine](/wordpress/i-built-this/2016/01/30/mine-wordpress-theme) and [Pummel](/i-built-this/wordpress/2015/12/02/introducing-pummel-wordpress-theme). Compared to WordPress themes, I found Jekyll theming to be more straight forward. 

Another challenge was the lack of comments. This was easily solved by using [Disqus](https://disqus.com). 

The site is still a work in progress. 

* I need investigate the SEO abilities as compared to WordPress and Yoast. 
* I would like to create archive pages for categories and tags.
* I still need to integrate social sharing for each post.

I know that there are plugins to enable some of these features, but GitHub Pages restricts the use of all but a few plugins, and I can't bring myself to pass on the free hosting! :smile:
